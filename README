This software is based on the paper
Olivier Fercoq (2019). "A generic coordinate descent solver for non-smooth convex optimisation". Optimization Methods and Software, 1-21.

The user defines an optimization problem of the form
min_x sum_j cf[j] * f[j](Af[j] * x - bf[j]) + sum_i cg[i] * g[i](Dg[i] * x[i] - bg[i]) + sum_l ch[l] * h[l](Ah[l] * x - ch[l])
where f[j] is differentiable and g[i] and h[l] have simple proximal operators.

The vectors and matrices are entered as arrays or lists.
The functions are given as three lists of strings. Each string corresponds to a pre-compiled atom
which can compute the function value, gradient, Lipschitz constant of the gradient and proximal operator.
When the functions are not separable, the arguments blocks, blocks_h and blocks_f may be used.

Examples are provided in the file test.py

The solver solves the optimization problem using a coordinate descent method. Under the hood, efficient residual updates and duplication of dual variables are performed.

The algorithms that are implemented are described in
